# PyQtPoker
A poker game based on python.

This is the first block of my ambitious plan to create a poker game built in python. We should be able to play locally and over the internet, atleast that's the plan right now. I'm planning to use PyQt6 for this project.

Is it possible? I dont know, let's find out.
Why python? that's the language that I'm familiar with.
Why poker? I think that it's a great card table top game which involvs to have good strategy to win over number of rounds.

Here is the AI sketch of my idea:
